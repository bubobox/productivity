Productivity automation
=======================

Some automation scripts that will boost the productivity.

Install
-------
Download the repository and do `make install` in the root of the repository to install the apps in your applications folder.
If you are planning to use it via Alfred you don't have to do the make install step. Just open alfred and type `BuboBox`.

Apps
----
* __Productivity on:__ Will disable all notifications, and set the status of your Skype and HipChat to "Do not disturb"
* __Productivity off:__ Enable all notifications again and set the status of Skype and HipChat to "Online"
* _Presentation on:_ The same as productivity mode but this will also hide all your desktop items (Not available yet)
* _Presentation off:_ The same os productivity off but it will also unhide your desktop items (Not available yet)
* __Pomodoro:__ This will start a productivity block of 25 minutes. After these 25 minutes you get the question if you want to contiue for another 25 minutes or take a break. There is still a bug in this script that causes the dialog to popup at the start of the script without taking the delay into account.

Todo
----
* When in productivity mode block facebook.com and some other websites via the hosts file. (Disadvantage is that user will have to type his password to allow this)
