Install
-------
Download the repository and do `make install` in the root of the repository to install the apps in your applications folder.
If you are planning to use it via Alfred you don't have to do the make install step. Just open alfred and type `BuboBox`.

Apps
----
* __Productivity on:__ Will disable all notifications, and set the status of your Skype and HipChat to "Do not disturb"
* __Productivity off:__ Enable all notifications again and set the status of Skype and HipChat to "Online"
* _Presentation on:_ The same as productivity mode but this will also hide all your desktop items
* _Presentation off:_ The same os productivity off but it will also unhide your desktop items

Todo

* When in productivity mode block facebook.com and some other websites via the hosts file. (Disadvantage is that user will have to type his password to allow this)
